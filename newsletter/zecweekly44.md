## This Week's Education Piece 

In this week educational piece, we will be learning about a decentralized system which can be used to store and share files on the Internet through a tool known as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In this tutorial, you will also learn how you can publish your your website on IPFS to enable a complete decentralized process on your website. 

Learn more about IPFS [here](https://wiki.zechub.xyz/zfav/guides/publish-a-site-on-ipfs)
