## This week's education piece

This week Zechub released a new installment of Zero to Zero Knowledge focusing on Lelantus. 
We learn the protocol is an improvement upon Zerocoin used by the Firo currency. To begin the difference between Zerocoin & Zerocash is explained, then into how anonymity is achieved within the Zerocoin paradigm including its limitations.

The thread goes on to detail the technologies used and how the future work on other privacy projects mirrors the exact path Zcash is already on.
