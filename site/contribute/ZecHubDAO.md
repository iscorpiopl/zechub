![Governance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81990132/206885452-29b6ff27-c58f-4361-b5a8-1529212def03.png)

The ZecHub DAO currently consists of :

* @squirrel
* @yoditar.zkp 
* @gordonesroo 
* @michae2xl 
* @dismad 
* @tokidoki 
* @decentralistdan
* @RedNosedGnome
* @Mine
* @Edicksonjga
* @vito
* @ZcashRU

The DAO will serve as an experiment for future Zcash organizations who are interested in new forms of decentralized governance models, and ZEC’s utility cross-chain.

## What is a DAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.

DAOs need the following elements for being fully functional: 

* A set of rules to which will operate
* Funding like tokens that the organization can spend to reward certain activities to their members
* Provide voting rights for establishing the operation rules. 
* A well and secure structure that allows every member to configure the organization.  

## What makes ZecHub unique?

ZecHub is one of the first public DAO's in Zcash's history. A unique aspect of the DAO is how its funds are held in Shielded Zcash address, compared to most DAO's that live on Ethereum. We have also created a [NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/zechub) for establishing voting rights.

## Governance

All DAO proposals are public and can be viewed [here](https://snapshot.org/#/zechubdao.eth). Any current member of the ZecHubDAO can create a proposal to vote on. In an effort to support community transparency, the ZecHubDAO will post all governance proposals in [this](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zechub-is-now-a-dao/43674) forum thread.
