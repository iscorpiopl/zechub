# Hardware Wallets

A hardware wallet is a special type of wallet that stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device. The private keys never leave the device, ensuring that there is no risk of losing funds even if the device is exposed to a potentially infected computer. Hardware wallets offer the security of a cold wallet or paper wallet but with the benefit of accessibility similar to hot wallets.

- Trezor devices are hardware wallets. The Trezor hardware architecture is public and the Trezor bootloader and firmware are completely open-source, which allows the user to independently verify the functionality and security of Trezor devices. With Trezor Suite and Trezor Bridge, using your Trezor device is as convenient as using a web wallet.
